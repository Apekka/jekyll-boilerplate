# Installation

**[Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/): module bundler**

1. To use the `webpack` CLI, install webpack globally: `npm install webpack -g`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

**[Bower](http://bower.io/): package manager for the web**

Bower makes fetching and installing packages from all over the web easier. If your project has a `bower.json` (like our example), run: `bower install`

# Webpack

Run once: `webpack`

Run and compress output: `webpack -p`

Run and output with source-maps: `webpack -d`

Run and watch for changes (plus prettier output): `webpack --progress --colors --watch`
